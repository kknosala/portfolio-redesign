    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My name is Kurt Knosala. I am currently a technical trainer at Good
      Sam Camping World but I am transitioning into Full Stack Development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will be learning
      several other programs and languages as the boot camp progresses. I
      have a strong background in sales and customer service training as
      well as public speaking for large groups of people. I am
      detail-oriented and enjoy problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      My current goal is to find a position where I can utilize the skills I
      am learning and where I can grow professionally. My ideal workplace is
      a strongly cooperative place that values its team members and also
      works to develop their skills as well as proving challenging work.
    </p>
